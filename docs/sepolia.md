# Testing the Bridge on Sepolia Testnet

## Prerequisites

- A wallet compatible with Ethereum-based networks (e.g., MetaMask).
- Access to the Sepolia testnet within your wallet.
- Some testnet ETH for transaction fees (which can be obtained from a Sepolia faucet).

## Steps

This guide will walk you through the process of testing our blockchain bridge on the Sepolia testnet.

1. Please mint an NFT on the Everai test collection by calling the `mintRangeFree` function on the contract https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x2a96b2293e4f4233fb36410e150ed86c742416a0#writeContract

2. After minting your NFT, proceed to transfer it across networks using our bridge: https://sepolia.bridge.arkproject.dev

# Testing the Bridge on Sepolia Testnet

This guide will walk you through the process of testing our blockchain bridge on the Sepolia testnet. The bridge facilitates transactions between different blockchain networks, specifically focusing on NFT transfers for this test. You'll start by minting an NFT on the Everai test collection and then use our bridge to complete a transaction.

Prerequisites
A wallet compatible with Ethereum-based networks (e.g., MetaMask).
Access to the Sepolia testnet within your wallet.
Some testnet ETH for transaction fees (which can be obtained from a Sepolia faucet).
Step 1: Mint an NFT on the Everai Test Collection
First, you need to mint an NFT from the Everai test collection. Here’s how to do it:

Connect your wallet to Sepolia Testnet. Ensure your wallet is switched to the Sepolia network.
Navigate to Etherscan for Sepolia. Go to the Sepolia version of Etherscan at https://sepolia.etherscan.io/.
Access the Everai Test Collection contract. Use the following contract address to find the Everai Test Collection: 0x2a96b2293e4f4233fb36410e150ed86c742416a0
Mint your NFT using the freemint function. Locate the freemint function on the contract’s page and execute it. You might need some Sepolia ETH to cover the gas fees for this transaction.
Step 2: Use the Bridge on Sepolia
After minting your NFT, proceed to transfer it across networks using our bridge:

Visit the Bridge Interface. Open your web browser and go to https://sepolia.bridge.arkproject.dev.
Connect Your Wallet. Ensure your wallet is connected to the Sepolia testnet and detected by the bridge interface.
Follow the Bridge Instructions. The bridge interface will guide you through the process of selecting the NFT you minted and initiating the transfer to another network. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the bridge transaction.
Conclusion
Testing our bridge on the Sepolia testnet allows you to experience firsthand how cross-network transactions occur, particularly with NFTs. This testing phase is crucial for identifying potential issues and ensuring smooth functionality across different blockchains. Your feedback and test results are invaluable to us, so please feel free to report any findings or suggestions you have.
